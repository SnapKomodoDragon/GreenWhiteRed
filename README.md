# GreenWhiteRed
A Chrome extension for better education

This will be a system for allowing students to indicate their learning state very easily, and the teacher
(and perhaps other students) to be able to see it. 

The browser (Chrome) extension will simply allow the student to choose a colour - white (in the zone), 
red (struggling/need help) or green (too easy).

Via a different page/console, the teacher will be able to see a list of the students in their class, and their current state.
Optionally, other students may be able to see student state as well, for example, for 'green' students to be able to find and 
assist 'red' students. This page might be implemented in a google sheet, or via a custom web app.

Possibilities for extension/awesomeness:
* When a green state is selected, it shows the students which red students they could help (or randomly choose one). And when 
red state is selected, shows green students to go get help from.
* The teacher can start a class with a pre-defined time, that will instantly connect the students in that class to a 'session'.
If done this way, there will be no action required from the students in order to use this
* Periodically ask the student how they're going in order to remind them to set their state.
* History of a student state for a teacher to be able to view.
* Android/iOS apps? Not sure how useful these would be.
